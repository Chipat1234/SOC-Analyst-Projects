# PCAP Traffic Analysis using Wireshark

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates SOC-style network traffic analysis using a packet capture (PCAP) file. The objective is to analyze network communication, identify protocols, and understand traffic behavior using Wireshark.

The analysis was performed in a controlled lab environment using Kali Linux.

## Tools Used
- Wireshark
- tcpdump
- Kali Linux

## Project Objectives
- Capture live network traffic
- Analyze PCAP files using Wireshark
- Identify common network protocols
- Perform HTTP and ICMP traffic analysis
- Document findings in a SOC-style report

## Analysis Summary
- Reviewed protocol hierarchy to identify traffic distribution
- Analyzed HTTP traffic to observe unencrypted requests
- Inspected ICMP traffic for connectivity verification
- Examined packet-level details for deeper inspection

## Files in This Repository
- `soc-traffic.pcap` – Captured network traffic
- `analysis.md` – Detailed traffic analysis report
- `screenshots/` – Evidence of analysis steps and findings

## Skills Demonstrated
- Network traffic analysis
- PCAP investigation
- Wireshark filtering and inspection
- SOC investigation methodology
- Incident analysis fundamentals

## Conclusion
This project highlights foundational SOC analyst skills required for monitoring, analyzing, and investigating network traffic using PCAP files and Wireshark.
